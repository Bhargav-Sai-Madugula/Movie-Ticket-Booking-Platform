        <h2 >Booking Management System is a project that allows users to check for available seats in the theatre and can even book them at the same time. It happens when people go for a movie and they return in disappointment due to houseful. Hence the project is intended to overcome this situation by automating the manual booking system, online. Users can make prior bookings for desired seats for their desired movie.  It also calculates all the associated charges incurred in booking the ticket. </h2>
